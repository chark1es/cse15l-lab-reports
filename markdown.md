## Markdown is able to be *styled*

- You can make lists
  - Even sublist like this
 
You can also use codeblocks. This is an `inline` codeblock while this is a full codeblock:

```py
print("Hello World")

print("This is made with Github Pages")
```

This is all pretty cool.

Markdown is used everywhere, especially in readme files within github. You can actually see markdown in Discord! (Although not all markdown formats are supported).
