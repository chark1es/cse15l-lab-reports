## Markdown is able to be *styled*

There are different **headings**:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2

- You can make lists
  - Even sublist like this

Having [links](https://https://github.com/chark1es/cse15l-lab-reports/edit/main/markdown.md) is useful for providing sources or giving credit.
Adding images are useful as well ![Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg/350px-Markdown-mark.svg.png)

> What a inspiring quote.
 
You can also use codeblocks. This is an `inline` codeblock while this is a full codeblock:

```py
print("Hello World")

print("This is made with Github Pages")
```

This is all pretty cool.

Markdown is used everywhere, especially in readme files within github. You can actually see markdown in Discord! (Although not all markdown formats are supported).
